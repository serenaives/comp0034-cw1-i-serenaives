# Meteorite Category

## Questions Addressed
1. **How many** meteorites of each category have landed over the years?
2. **What proportion** of meteorites of each category have landed over the years?
3. What is the **relationship** between the amount/ proportion of meteorite landings by category and
   1. the geographical distribution of meteorite landings
   2. the year of meteorite landing/ discovery
   3. the mass of meteorites

## Visualisations: Bar Graph and Pie Chart

Since meteorite category is a discrete measure related here to questions of *how many* and 
*what proportion*, the classic bar and pie chart visualisations are appropriate. The option to coordinate
map markers to the colour of the bar/ segment meteorite category (as described in the design rationale for
the [scatter map plot](scatter_plot_map.md)), and the ability to make points corresponding to certain
categories appear/ disappear simultaneously on the map and bar chart by selecting/ deselecting legend
items addresses question 3i, while the range sliders in the control box help address questions 3ii and iii.
