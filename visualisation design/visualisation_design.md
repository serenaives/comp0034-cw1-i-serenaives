# Visualisation Design

## Target Audience
The target audience is GCSE Maths students aged 15-16. This application is intended to
complement the Statistics component of GCSE Maths, which specifies the
following learning objectives (Department for Education, 2016):
1. Interpret tables, charts and diagrams and know their appropriate use, including:
   1. frequency tables, bar charts and pie charts for categorical data,
   2. vertical line charts for ungrouped discrete numerical data
   3. tables and line graphs for time series data 
   4. interpret diagrams for grouped discrete data and continuous data, i.e. histograms
2. Interpret, analyse and compare the distributions of data sets from univariate empirical 
distributions through:
   1. appropriate graphical representation involving discrete, continuous and grouped data,
   including box plots
   2. appropriate measures of central tendency
3. Apply statistics to describe a population

With the goal of helping students gain an understanding of these core statistical concepts, the application takes the form of a 
dashboard that allows users to visualise NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset through various visualisations as 
referenced in the syllabus. The chosen dataset is ideal as it includes discrete, continuous and grouped data, 
giving students the opportunity to familiarise themselves with various data types.

The application targets ambitious students eager to learn and willing to explore the syllabus content in their own time.
The intended target audience also has at least a mild interest in meteorites, as the core idea is that giving students
the opportunity to apply the tools they have been taught in the classroom to learn about a topic of personal interest will
encourage further engagement and an improved understanding of the syllabus content. The application is open-source in the
interest of widening equal access to educational resources.

This is an online application intended for desktop use, as it is assumed that the target audience, given the age group,
is familiar with technology and has access to an internet connection and laptops or desktop computers, either personally or
through school. Although it is safe to assume that using the application will be intuitive and overly detailed
guidance unnecessary, it is important that the user-interface maintains a simple and clear structure, as the data visualisations
themselves are expected to be relatively unfamiliar to users. It is likely that being faced with a webpage containing many visualisations
at once and lacking a clear structure could be overwhelming.

## Questions to be Addressed


1. 

## Design Approach
data filters, interactivity, control boxes, general visual appearance of the dashboard
UI should be intuiotive and simple, not overwhelming (tab structure etc)
