## Visualisation: Line Graph

Line Graphs are used to display quantitative values over a continuous interval or time period. A Line Graph is most frequently used to show trends and analyse how the data has changed over time.
The direction of the lines on the graph works as a nice metaphor for the data: 

design choice to keep ALL trace invisible at first, can choose to select it, but 2 lines together would be cluttered
especially as so many more found than fell means all is v close to found and v cluttered looking. also all includes data from both 

hovermode allows u to visualise it more as a journey through time
particularly important as there are no gridlines

could have filtered by category in each year too but would have been cluttered

interactive year slider to determine scale because trying to get the right balance between
sim- plicity, granularity and coverage (Wilkinson, Grammar of Graphics - properties of a good scale)

boundaries: MINIMUM TO MAXIMUM
 it is good practice to extend the scales beyond the observed lim- its and to use readily understandable rounded values.

here is no obligatory require- ment to include zero in a scale, but there should always be a reason for not doing so; otherwise it makes the reader wonder if some deception is being practiced.

evaluaiton
- automatically the y-axis scale was set to 1 and zero data not included - misleading
- then it looks like no data when just 1 per year - had to fill empty vals w zero and manually adjust y axis
- changed it to zero so as not to mislead/ confuse (cite )
- here is no obligatory require- ment to include zero in a scale, but there should always be a reason for not doing so; otherwise it makes the reader wonder if some deception is being practiced (pdf).
- as there is data = to zero

could have extended the axes further (cite pdf) this is always advisable but this would have added potential confusion
as not clear wheere the start/end points are. but it is cfamped and start/ end points are a bit obscured
