# COMP0034 Coursework

Link to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ucl-comp0035/comp0034-cw1-i-serenaives)

This repository contains the coursework submitted for UCL's module COMP0035 *Application
Programming for Data Science*.

The first stage of the project was to create a Python Dash application that uses data from a chosen dataset.
I used a dataset on meteorite landings from NASA to create an interactive dashboard of visualisations.

The directory `coursework 1` contains the code for the Dash app, which is all contained within
`dash_app.py`, although an improved structure might split the layout and callbacks into separate files to
improve readability.

The sub-folder `visualisation design` containing the .md files which contain
screenshots of the application and outline the rationale for the design of the visualisations 
used in the dashboard. Reading these files should start with
[visualisation_design.md](/coursework_1/visualisation%20design/visualisation_design.md).

The second stage of the project is the web application created using the Python-based web framework Flask.
This application integrates the dashboard from the first stage within an application which allows users to 
view the dashboard as well as take a quiz, the results of which are recorded and used to display an updated
leaderboard.

The code for this stage of the project is in the directory `coursework_2`. The structure of
the code is as follows:
- `dashboard` contains the code from the Dash app used in coursework 1 with some minor adjustments to code structure
(splitting layouts and callbacks) and style (made colour scheme consistent with the rest of the web app) that were
necessary for integrating it within the Flask app
- `data` is the directory used to save the database generated by the application
- `static` contains images, javascript and css files used in the styling of the application
- `templates` contains the html files which template the pages displayed by the web app. These files use 
Jinja to dynamically generate these pages

## Running the Applications
- In order to run either application, you will first need to clone this repository
  - Use `git clone https://github.com/ucl-comp0035/comp0034-cw1-i-serenaives.git`
- See `requirements.txt` for the dependencies which should be installed before running either application
  - Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project directory
  - Note that it may be convenient to use a virtual environment to avoid complications with dependencies
  from other projects
- The two applications run separately
  - For coursework 1 (visualisation dashboard), run `dash_app.py`
  - For coursework 2 (web app), run `run.py`
- Both applications run on local server http://127.0.0.1:5000
  - Note that the URL for this server is hardcoded into the dash app's redirect back to main page button.
  This should be changed manually if you are not running the application on the same development server

## Note on copyright
- The dataset used in this project is [Meteorite Landings via NASA Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh)
- All python libraries used, including Dash and Flask, are open source.

- The open-source CSS framework Bootstrap was used for styling, with Bootswatch's
*Minty* theme as a template

- I created all the images used in the web application myself using the vector-drawing
application Graphic, but I had some trouble with the meteorite and ended up drawing very
heavily from [this image](https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/cute-meteorite-kawaii-comic-character-icon-vector-id1199462490?k=20&m=1199462490&s=170667a&w=0&h=w6YaFZVoXv44F3jULPZ-v1XZX0OyxJ_CI0tw6XZWLCo=)
