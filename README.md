## Data
The dataset used in this project is [Meteorite Landings via NASA Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh).

## Visualisation design
The rationale for the design of the visualisations used in the dashboard is outlined in [visualisation_design.md](/coursework_1/visualisation%20design/visualisation_design.md).

## Additional Information
- see [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) for dependencies
- The application runs on local server http://127.0.0.1:5000
  - Note that the URL for this server is hardcoded into the dash app's redirect back to main page button.
  This should be changed manually if you are not running the application on the same development server.
